# Weissenberg-effect
This project demonstrates the Weissenberg Effect (Rod Climbing Effect) in viscoelastic fluids by developing an experimental setup. It investigates how fluid properties and rotational speed influence climbing behavior using an Arduino-controlled stepper motor and high-speed imaging for analysis.
